This directory contains scripts to generate example plots:

1. ``plot-figure.py``: will generate a standard plot using the ``science`` style. This style is suitable for most scientific writing (i.e., journals, theses, etc.).

2. ``plot-subfigure.py``: will generate a sub-figure plot using the ``science`` and ``subfigure`` styles. This style combination is suitable for having two figures side-by-side on a4 paper. See ``subfigure-example.png`` for an example from my thesis.

3. ``plot-square.py``: will generate a square scatter plot using the ``science`` style. Note that the ``figsize`` was set manually in this case.
